        <p>
          Since its founding in 1954, Clarins has passed on its passion for
          beauty from one generation to the next. From the iconic Lip Comfort
          Oil to the bestselling <em>Beauty Flash Balm</em>, Clarins has
          remained synonymous with authentic French beauty, championing women’s
          desire to feel their best, their way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by the science of nature and committed to reducing our impact
          on the planet, Clarins continues to design and produce its products in
          France and remains faithful to its original philosophy - listening to
          women to truly understand their needs, and developing natural origin
          and highly effective skincare products.

        <p>
          Above all, Clarins is the story of a French family. It all began in
          Paris on March 15, 1954, when Jacques Courtin-Clarins opened his first
          Clarins Institute with the pioneering belief that well-being and
          happiness were inextricably linked to beauty⁠—a daring holistic vision
          that would go on to change the face of French beauty. Today, the
          Courtin-Clarins family continues to lead the brand with passion and
          determination, honoring the heritage of one of France's best-loved
          Maisons while looking resolutely toward the future.
